Created a sample SQLite database (ecommerce.db) with customers, products, and orders tables.
Performed SQL queries using DB Browser to analyze sales, revenue, and customer behavior.
Used JOINs, aggregate functions, subqueries, and calculated fields to extract insights.
Saved all queries and output screenshots as part of the final internship deliverables.
